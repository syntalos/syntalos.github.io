Record a stream of frames as video.


Usage
=====

This module has a multitude of settings to configure the recording and select a good balance between quality and speed.

It also permits encoding to be deferred to after the experiment run, to save resources for data acquisition during a run
(this will require a lot of disk space temporarily, so ensure you have enough space available).
