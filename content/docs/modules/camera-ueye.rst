The "uEye Camera" module can connect to many `IDS Imaging Development Systems <https://en.ids-imaging.com/>`_ camera that
can be addressed using their propriatery SDK.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
This module is currently lacking a maintainer and is not built by default, due to its reliance on
the proprietary SDK and due to not having been tested for a long time.
If you want to use it, some work to refresh its code may be required.
