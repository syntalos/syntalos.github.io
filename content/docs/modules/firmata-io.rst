This module can connect with any device speaking the `Firmata Protocol <https://github.com/firmata/protocol>`_ via
a serial port.


Usage
=====

Configure as usual by setting a serial device to connect to.

.. note::
    If the device does not show up for selection or you get a permission error,
    you may need to add yourself to the ``dialout`` group to use serial devices.
    In order to do that, open a terminal and enter ``sudo adduser $USER dialout``, confirming with
    you administrator password. Then log in again.

This module needs another module to be useful.
