This module can connects with a Raspberry Pi Pico running dedicated firmware to
drive a Superior Sensors `SP210 spirometry pressure sensor <https://superiorsensors.com/pressure-sensors/spirometry/>`_.

Pico firmware is provided. The Syntalos module will export the sensor's pressure and temperature
readings and allow a range of configuration options.


Usage
=====

This module needs a Raspberry Pi Pico connected to the pressure sensor via I2C as well as the respective firmware
flashed to the Pico chip. (TODO: Add instructions for assembly)

Once added to a Syntalos project, the module will acquire data with the selected sampling rate and zeroing
settings. Data can be recorded e.g. using a *JSON Writer* module, or displayed via a *Plot Time Series* module.
