This module provides support for recording data with `UCLA Miniscope <https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-v4>`_ devices.
(This sometimes also includes industrial cameras for which no specialized drivers exist).


Usage
=====

Configure as usual.
Please ensure that when recording data, the raw frames are recorded and the displayed frames are displayed in a `Canvas`,
and not the other way round! Otherwise the recorded data may be incomplete.
