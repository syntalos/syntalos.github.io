This is the simplest introduction to Syntalos, to get familiar with its interface
and its modules.

## 1. Installing Syntalos

First, you need to install Syntalos. Syntalos only runs on Linux, but don't be scared about that.
If you are not already running it, Linux is easy to install on your DAQ computer, and
can even be tested without any installation.
For beginners, Ubuntu or Pop!_OS are solid choices in Linux distribution, for more skilled
users Debian, Fedora or OpenSUSE are a good choice.

Then, you can just install Syntalos by searching for it in the App Store, or by
[following the installation instructions]({{< ref "/docs/setup/install" >}})
in case you can not find it there.

## 2. A first module

Upon first launching Syntalos, it opens with a blank window with fields for experiment details between
an upper toolbar and a lower toolbar:

![Syntalos: First run](/images/syntalos-firstrun.avif)

The upper toolbar contains settings affecting the whole application or its state, the middle experiment details
concern the currently planned experiment run, and the lower toolbar is used to manipulate modules and change
the experiment configuration.

Syntalos alone does not do much. In order to make it perform tasks, it needs modules. And modules need to be connected
to form an experiment setup. Let's add one by clicking the *Add Module* button in the lower toolbar!

![Let's add a module!](/images/syntalos-module-add.avif)

Select the *Audio Source* module and click *OK*, or just double-click on it. The module will appear on the white
space, represented as a block.

## 3. Module Settings

Now that we have a module, we can manipulate it! Click on the module box. The module toolbar should now highlight
a few buttons that were previously grayed out:

![A module was selected](/images/syntalos-module-selected.avif)

The *Connect* options are useful when you have multiple modules wired together - we are not there yet! A click on *Remove*
will delete the module again.

Every module can display two kinds of windows: *Settings* windows and *Display* windows. Settings windows usually contain
settings for the module that are saved with the Syntalos project files, while display windows usually either just display
the module's output or contain transient settings that are not saved and only affect the displayed output.

In our case, the *Audio Source* module has no display windows, so the *Display* button is disabled. It does however have
settings, which we do want to inspect. Click on the *Settings* button, or double-click the module box!

{{< callout type="info" >}}
If you double-click on a module box, its display windows are shown and brought in focus by your window manager.
If the module does not have any display windows, its settings will be opened by default instead.
{{< /callout >}}

In the settings of *Audio Source*, we just tick the box *Start playback immediately* for now.

## 4. Launch!

We are ready to run our configuration! We do not want to save any data that would be recorded though, so we hit the
*Ephemeral Run* button:

![A module was selected](/images/syntalos-ephemeral-run-button.avif)

You should now hear a sine wave of the selected frequency from your speakers!
To stop the experiment run, hit the *Stop* button.

## 5. Relaunch! (With saved data)

If we do want to save any data, we do need to set a location where it should be stored. Click on the *Folder* button
in the *Export Directory* line, and select a path where your data should be stored (❶).
You can then give your test subject a name, as well as name the experiment itself in the text fields below.
If you want to, you can also have a look at per-project settings that influence data storage behavior, and allow you
to create a list of test subjects to choose from, instead of having to type them in manually every time (❷).

![Setting an export directory](/images/syntalos-setexportdir.avif)

After configuring this, the *Play* button in the top left corner of the main toolbar should now be enabled.
If you click it, the experiment is run, and data is saved. Since we did not add any modules that actually generate
data, all that will be saved is a bit of metadata about the current experiment run.

## 6. Saving the Project

Either click the *Save* button or select *File → Save Project* from the menu to save the current project with all
its added modules, their settings and data storage location.

You will later be able to open it again via *Open Project* to resume your experiments.
